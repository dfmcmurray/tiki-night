		Tiki Night 2013 will be located in the heart of Hollywood. Because this is a high pedestrian traffic area we ask that you please be extremely courteous to everyone around you while coming and going from our event. We could never raise funds for the National MS Society without the cooperation of Sweet! Hollywood, Hollywood & Highland, and all of you.
