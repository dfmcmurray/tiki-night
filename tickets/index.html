	<h2>Important Stuff</h2>

	<h3>WHATS NEW FOR 2013?</h3>

	<p>
		<strong>Well... for starters... WE'VE MOVED!</strong> So make sure you don't go to Mr. Miller's home!!! It will be empty, dark, and void of Tiki torches. Worse yet, if you knock on his door, he'll just giggle at you because you didn't read this web site, our Facebook page, or our Twitter feed.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>RED CARPET ARRIVALS</strong> are courtesy of Sweet! Hollywood and a few other folks we can't mention right now.  We suggest you bring your cameras and soak up the Sweet! Hollywood vibe!
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>THE 501st: VADER'S FIRST</strong> have found their way to Tiki Night 2013 by special invitation.  They've notified Lord Vader HIMSELF and his charge who will be checking in on each and every one of our guests at Tiki Night. Do not be afraid. They're just looking for members of the Rebel Alliance. And whatever you do... do  NOT "Vader" Lord Vader. You'll just... well, it won't turn out well!
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>GUITAR HERO TOURNAMENT, PAC MAN TOURNAMENT, AND THE BLACK JACK TABLE</strong> are all new activities we think you'll love. The entry fees are minimal and you can win some fabulous prizes.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>SILENT AUCTION ITEMS</strong> will be displayed and you can bid on them! We're still gathering them, but we know one of the prizes will be an XBOX Gaming System complete with two games, two DVD Titles, and a few other items we're throwing in.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>THE OFFICIAL TEAM TIKI HA HA CANDY BAR</strong> is courtesy of Sweet! Hollywood. A portion of every team candy bar sale will be donated to the National MS Society thanks to the good folks at Sweet!
	</p>

	<h3>HOW CAN I PAY FOR STUFF?</h3>

	<p>
		Tiki Night accepts Cash, Visa, MasterCards, American Express, and Discover Card. Advance ticket sales through Sold Out Crowd accepts the same.  We encourage you to purchase your tickets in advance and on the web so that you are guaranteed a ticket for the event. It'll also help us figure out how much food, drink, and supplies to order prior to your arrival.  Heaven forbid we run out of anything!
	</p>

	<h3>BEHAVE YOURSELF</h3>

	<p>
		We will continue to stress that this is a business area and we need to respect the other guests, shoppers, tourists, and businesses located around us.  It is partially these people who are allowing us to do this event for the National MS Society.
	</p>

	<h3>ACCESSIBILITY</h3>

	<p>
		<strong>WE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.</strong> Tiki Night 2013 has become accessible for those who need it! Got a wheelchair? No problem! We request that you please check in with Hollywood & Highland Center for more information.
	</p>

	<h3>PROOF OF AGE REQUIRED</h3>

	<p>
		You must pick up your tickets at our Box Office on the night of the event. ID will be checked at that time. Bring it, and don't be shy to show us your age!  All guests will be wrist banded no matter how old you are. And our bartenders will also check for proof of ID when you order your drinks. Donâ€™t fight it. We need to do this for your comfort and safety. 
	</p>

	<h3>DON'T FORGET YOUR SWAG BAG</h3>

	<p>
		Before you leave us for the evening, please don't forget to stop by the Box Office with your Swag Bag Voucher. We've got some pretty nifty stuff to give you from some generous people around Southern California. And yes... THERE WILL BE CANDY.
