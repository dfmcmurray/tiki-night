	<h2>Important Stuff</h2>

	<h3>HOW CAN I PAY FOR STUFF?</h3>

	<p>
		Tiki Night accepts Cash, Visa, MasterCards, American Express, and Discover Card. Advance ticket sales through Sold Out Crowd accepts the same.  We encourage you to purchase your tickets in advance and on the web so that you are guaranteed a ticket for the event. It'll also help us figure out how much food, drink, and supplies to order prior to your arrival.  Heaven forbid we run out of anything!
	</p>

	<h3>BEHAVE YOURSELF</h3>

	<p>
		We will continue to stress that this is a business area and we need to respect the other guests, shoppers, tourists, and businesses located around us.  It is partially these people who are allowing us to do this event for the National MS Society.
	</p>

	<h3>ACCESSIBILITY</h3>

	<p>
		<strong>WE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.</strong> Tiki Night has become accessible for those who need it! Got a wheelchair? No problem! We request that you please check in with Hollywood & Highland Center for more information.
	</p>

	<h3>PROOF OF AGE REQUIRED</h3>

	<p>
		You must pick up your tickets at our Box Office on the night of the event. ID will be checked at that time. Bring it, and don't be shy to show us your age!  All guests will be wrist banded no matter how old you are. And our bartenders will also check for proof of ID when you order your drinks. Donâ€™t fight it. We need to do this for your comfort and safety. 
	</p>

	<h3>DON'T FORGET YOUR SWAG BAG</h3>

	<p>
		Before you leave us for the evening, please don't forget to stop by the Box Office with your Swag Bag Voucher. We've got some pretty nifty stuff to give you from some generous people around Southern California. And yes... THERE WILL BE CANDY.
